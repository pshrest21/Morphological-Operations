# Morphological-Operations
This project will give you general idea about morphological operations in python. I will be using different inbuilt opencv functions to perform erosion, dialation, opening, closing, and three types of boundary detection

The operations will be performed in olemiss.jpg image. I have also attached the individual result of each operations named accordingly
